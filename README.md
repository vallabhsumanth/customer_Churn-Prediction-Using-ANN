# Customer_Churn-Prediction-Using-ANN

Predict customer churn using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with this repository. Train, evaluate, and visualize churn models using  Keras. Achieve insights and improve retention strategies.
Methodology
## Data Collection:

Gathered historical customer data from various sources, including demographics, transaction history, and interaction logs.

## Data Preprocessing:

Performed data cleaning to handle missing values and outliers.
Conducted feature engineering to extract relevant features for churn prediction.
Applied techniques such as one-hot encoding for categorical variables and scaling for numerical features.

## Model Architecture

Designed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture for customer churn prediction.
Configured multiple layers with customizable neurons and activation functions.
Experimented with different architectures to optimize model performance.
## Model Training:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).
Trained the ANN model using TensorFlow and Keras.
Utilized techniques like batch normalization and dropout to prevent overfitting.
